# Traffic Lights Application

## Description

The Traffic Lights Application is a simple React application that simulates a traffic light system. It cycles through three lights: red, yellow, and green, changing every 2 seconds. This project is an excellent way to practice React concepts, including state management and the use of hooks like `useEffect`.

## Features

- **Traffic Light Simulation**: Displays a traffic light that cycles through red, yellow, and green lights.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work on various screen sizes.
- **Clean UI**: A simple and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: For styling the traffic light components.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
